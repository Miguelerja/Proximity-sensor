<h1>Proximity alarm system</h1>

This program controls a simple Arduino system that detects the objects in front of it and gives feedback depending on their distance:
* **30 cm or more**: Green light on
* **20 cm to 30 cm**: Yellow light on
* **10 cm to 20 cm**: Orange light on
* **Less than 10 cm**: Red light blinking and continuous buzzing sound.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

To run the program you will need node and enough hardware to build the attached circuit:

* Ultrasound sensor HC-SR04
* RGB LED
* Passive buzzer
* 3x 220 Ohm resistors
* Jumper wires
* Arduino like board and USB cable
